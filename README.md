`analysis.py` evaluates the Randomizer-generated sequences according to a number of metrics.

`compare.py` performs a multidimensional distance comparison, in an attempt to quantify the similarity of the randomizers based on the reported metrics.

`testgame.py` is a TAP-like game for testing the randomizers. It uses [pygame](http://pygame.org).

The `piecedata` directory contains rotation system data.
